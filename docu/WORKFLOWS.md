## Used [Workflows](profile/workflows)

###
### [Mastodon Poster](profile/workflows/post_to_mastodon.yml)
- Currently only posts pull request merges.
  - Sourced from [this Medium post](https://scidsg.medium.com/automate-posts-to-mastodon-with-github-actions-eb73a921c037).
- Still a Work in Progress...
###

#### It posts to [@OS1337_git@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@OS1337_git) as a seperate account.
- the main Mastodon account, [@OS1337@infosec.exchange ](https://infosec.exchange/@OS1337) is not automated.
  - This is done to reduce clutter since not everyone may want to see every commit, push, merge, pull request and so forth in their timeline...

It is inspired by the [linux](https://infosec.exchange/@linux@mstdn.social) and [pkgsrcchanges](https://infosec.exchange/@pkgsrcchanges@mstdn.social) Bots on [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/).
